FluxForge Roadmap
=================

**HPGe-driven flux-wire / foil activation analysis • Neutron spectrum unfolding • Model validation**  
**OpenMC 0.15.3 (CE transport ± depletion) vs MCNP6.3 + ALARA (group activation)**

Last Updated: 2026-01-02

Purpose
-------
Deliver an end-to-end, reproducible pipeline from HPGe spectra to unfolded
neutron spectra with full uncertainty propagation, then validate OpenMC and
MCNP+ALARA against experiment with auditable artifacts.

For the complete master plan including mathematical framework and STAYSL
integration details, see [master_plan.md](master_plan.md).

Guiding Principles
------------------
- **Artifact-driven pipeline:** every stage emits machine-readable outputs plus a short human summary
- **Provenance first:** inputs, versions, and settings are always captured
- **Deterministic outputs:** seeded RNG for MC sampling; reproducible by design
- **CLI-friendly:** no GUI required; core APIs designed for automation
- **Reference-based development:** learn from local repos in `testing/` but implement internally
